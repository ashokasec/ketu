# Ketu: Remote Control and Surveillance Tool

> Hey, this tool isn't quite ready for everyone to use. I built it for myself to learn how things work behind the scenes.

__Ketu__ is a cybersecurity project designed for remote control and monitoring. It offers a range of features to gather system information, retrieve WIFI passwords, manage the clipboard, send notifications, open links, capture screenshots, and implement keylogging.

## Features

- **System Information:** Retrieve detailed system information from the connected client.
- **WIFI Passwords:** Display past connected WIFI SSIDs and their corresponding passwords.
- **Clipboard Management:** Copy the client's clipboard content.
- **Notifications:** Send a notification to the client.
- **Open Links:** Open a provided link in the client's default web browser.
- **Screenshot Capture:** Capture and receive a screenshot from the client.
- **Keylogging:** Fetch the key log file from the client.

## Bonus - Data Visualization and Data Handling

The project includes a web interface (`index.html`) to visualize collected data. Open `index.html` in a web browser to view System Information, WIFI Passwords, and Clipboard content.

### Data Handling

Data is exported and imported in JSON format. The Python `json` module is utilized for this purpose. Collected data is stored in a `data.json` file. The web interface dynamically renders this data for visualization.

__Data Structure (JSON) in data.json__

```json
{
  "sysinfo": {
    "Username": "example_user",
    "Home Directory": "/home/example_user",
    "System": "Linux",
    "Node Name": "example-node",
    "Release": "4.15.0-112-generic",
    "Version": "#113-Ubuntu SMP Thu Jul 9 23:41:39 UTC 2020",
    "Machine": "x86_64",
    "Processor": "Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-8700 CPU @ 3.20GHz"
  },
  "show_wifi": [
    {"SSID": "WiFiNetwork1", "Password": "password1"},
    {"SSID": "WiFiNetwork2", "Password": "password2"}
  ],
   "cp_clipb": "Clipboard content goes here."
}
```

### Rendering Data

The web interface utilizes __JavaScript__ to dynamically render the collected data. Data from the `data.json` file is fetched __asynchronously__, and HTML elements are created based on the data's structure.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ashokasec/ketu.git
cd ketu
```

2. **Install Dependencies:**

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. **Run the Server:**

```bash
python server/server.py
```

4. **Run the Client:**

```bash
python client/client.py --address SERVER_IP
```
Replace `SERVER_IP` with the actual IP address where the server is running.
